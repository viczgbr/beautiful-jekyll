It is extremely frustrating to work in a toxic environment where so many things went wrong. To name a few:

1. Lack of effective communication
2. Bad decision making (by incompetent/uninformed personnel)
3. Information overload
4. Office politics

## Communication

## Product

## Competency

## In-fighting
