It is extremely frustrating to work in a toxic environment where so many things went wrong. To name a few:

1. Lack of effective communication
2. Bad decision making (by incompetent/uninformed personnel)
3. Information overload
4. Office politics

## Communication
When I studied at RMIT University, Dr Stas Lukaitis used to tell us that all problems in the world are caused by bad communications. 
## Product
When we first created the product, it was designed for specific needs of small organisations at the time. The lifespan of the product is not supposed to be this long without significant rewrite of its core components. There have been countless patches applied upon the broken product over many years. Meanwhile, most people who were invovled in product development/maintenance had been long gone. When they left the team, they also took away the product knowledge they possess. The entire product team now have to rely on a couple of developers who have sticked around long enough to know the product better than anyone else. It's also impossible to document everything or keep any existing documents up to date. The full-time documentation role had been made redundant to cut cost.
## Competency
Hiring the right people seems to be impossible these days.
## In-fighting
We all secretly hate each other.
